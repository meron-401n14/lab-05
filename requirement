People
Convert your people.js so that it properly uses your new model.js
Hint: We did this in the demo [/demo/mongo]
Move your schema definition into a new file called people-schema.js, and use Mongoose to properly define your schema
Hint: We did this in the demo [/demo/mongo]
Think about:
If something is an id, we should have a _ at the beginning of its key name
Add to your schema so that it matches the following rough outline (note: you will need to convert this to match Mongoose types)
{
  firstName: {required: true, type: 'string'},
  lastName: {required: true, type: 'string'},
  team: {required: false, type: 'id'},
  birthday: {required: true, type: 'date'},
  likes: {required: true, type: 'string', lowercase: true, enum: ['cats', 'dogs', 'none', 'both']}
}
Teams
Convert your teams.js so that it properly uses your new model.js
Hint: We did this in the demo [/demo/mongo]
Move your schema definition into a new file called teams-schema.js, and use Mongoose to properly define your schema
Hint: We did this in the demo [/demo/mongo]
Add to your schema so that it matches the following rough outline (note: you will need to convert this to match Mongoose types)
{
  name: {required: true, type: 'string'},
  color: {required: true, type: 'string', lowercase: true, enum: ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']}
}
Data Operations
Add each of your classmates to your database (do not set their teams). Add yourself as well, so that you have a total of 7 people
Add the following four teams:
{
  name: 'Red Heron',
  color: 'red'
}
{
  name: 'Blue Otter',
  color: 'blue'
}
{
  name: 'Yellow Rhino',
  color: 'yellow'
}
Randomly assign each person to a team, so that you have two teams of two and one team of three
In your index.js write a code that will do the following based on command line arguments:
No command line arguments: print the count of Teams and People
Name of a person command line argument: print the information for that person if a person was found. Print “No record found”, if that name doesn’t exist in the database
Name of a team command line argument: print the information for that team and the members of that team if the team name was found. Otherwise print “No record found”.
See sample output below:
>> node index.js

Teams: 3
People: 7
